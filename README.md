## Pseudo 3-tier architecture

The mvc architecture is a common design pattern in python web, but the 3-tier architecture is even more fascinating

In python web development, there is no common standard for the concept of 3-tier architecture, so we'll call it a
pseudo 3-tier architecture here

But please note that we don't have a traditional multi-app structure (django, springBoot...) If you don't like this
pattern, use templates to transform it to your heart's content!
